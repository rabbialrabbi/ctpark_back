## Project Architecture
This project is a web application that leverages Vue.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend API. Vue.js provides a dynamic, interactive user experience with a modern, single-page application (SPA) structure, while Laravel powers the backend to handle server-side operations, including data management, authentication, and API services. This structure enables a clear separation between the frontend and backend, making the project scalable, maintainable, and efficient.
